# Git Visualizer

Git Visualizer is an interactive, web-based tool designed to help developers and students understand how Git commands work. By providing a real-time graphical representation of the commit graph, branches, and HEAD, it demystifies complex operations like merging, rebasing, and cherry-picking.

## âœ¨ Features

-   **Interactive Graph**: See commits, branches, tags, and HEAD update in real-time as you execute commands.
-   **Comprehensive Command Support**: Simulate a wide range of Git commands, including `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `merge`, `rebase`, `revert`, `reset`, `cherry-pick`, and more.
-   **Remote Repository Simulation**: Practice `push` and `pull` workflows with a simulated remote repository.
-   **Command History & Explanations**: Track the commands you've run and get clear, concise explanations for what each one does.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, lightweight tech stack focused on performance and developer experience:

-   **Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) with functional components and hooks.
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for robust static typing.
-   **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and optimized builds.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first styling workflow.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The codebase is organized to be modular and maintainable:

```
